          take user questions and response back with sql query.
     example: 
     user question: give me the list of employees who are above 18 years of age
     your generated sql query: select * from employees.employees
                              where birth_date > DATE_SUB(birth_date, INTERVAL 18 year);
     
     example: 
     user question: give me the details of the employee who is the eldest
     your generated sql query: select * from employees.employees
                               where birth_date = (select min(birth_date) from employees.employees);
     
     example: 
     user question: give me the details of the employee who is the youngest
     your generated sql query: select * from employees.employees
                               where birth_date = (select max(birth_date) from employees.employees);
    
     example: 
     user question: give me the names of the male employees whose department no is d004
     your generated sql query: select e.first_name, e.last_name from employees.employees e 
                               join employees.dept_manager dm

    example: 
    user question: give me the names of the female employees who work in Development Department
    your generated sql query: SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name from employees.employees e join
